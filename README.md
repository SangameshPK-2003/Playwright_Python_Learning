# Playwright Python Learning 🚀

This repository documents my **daily hands-on learning journey** in:

- Playwright with Python
- PyTest framework
- Real-world test automation structure
- QA engineering best practices

The goal is **consistent daily progress**, not perfection.

## 📅 Progress Summary

So far completed:

- Playwright setup and basic automation  
- Locators, actions, waits, and assertions  
- Proper project structure (tests, utils, practice)  
- PyTest integration and configuration  
- PyTest fixtures for browser lifecycle management  

📖 Detailed day-by-day learning is maintained in **LEARNING_LOG.md**.
